4.	Once the user has answered all the question it will display the user socre on the final screen as well a message of feddback to them.

5.	The user will aslo be able to click a button to reivew the questons and the answer as well as see they answer to the quesiton and whether they have gotten it right or wrong

## Github Utilization

Used GitHub in order to upload my code and backup my project on a regular basis. As well as allow access to other users if they would like access to the code .This also allow me to access my code from any device and I will then be able to push the updates to GitHub in which it will then store in my repository.

## Github Actions
Used a workflow to test the code of the application once it is pushed to GitHub. If the test passes the code is then safe to merge. If it fails it will show error logs so that you can fix it
